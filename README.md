# GFM
GFM is the abbreviation of Generalized Factor Model. This toolbox is the implementation of  <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2021.1999818"> Generalized factor model for ultra-high dimensional variables with mixed types"</a> . If you require to use this toolbox in your research, please cite the paper.

## Advantage of computation
We develop a two-step iterative procedure so that each update can be carried out parallelly across all variables and samples. The fast computation version is provided for ultra-high data, see gfm_example.m file.
