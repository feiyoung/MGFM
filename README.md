# GFM
Generalized Factor Model: Generalized factor model for ultra-high dimensional variables with mixed types.
 
## Advantage of computation
We develop a two-step iterative procedure so that each update can be carried out parallelly across all variables and samples. The fast computation version is provided for ultra-high data, see gfm_example.m file.
